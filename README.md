Life

Implementation of two cellular automatons: [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) and [Seeds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeds_(cellular_automaton). Written in Python using Tkinter.

###Conway's Game of Life
The image shows many interesting patterns:
* Multiple still lifes (blocks, beehives, loafs and a boat).
* Multiple oscillators (mainly blinkers).
* A glider.

###Seeds
The pattern rapidly devolves into a caotic situation, specially in a small board.
